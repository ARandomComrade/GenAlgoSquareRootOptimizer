# GenAlgoSquareRootOptimizer
Uses the darwinian magic of a genetic algorithm to find the optimum solution of Heron's Algorithm.
Uses bitwise functions on a single precision float to act as the chromosome that the Genetic Operators of natural selection, mutations, and crossbreeding act on. 

#Heron's Method
Heron's algorithm (or method) is an iteratve method defined as xn+1=1/2*(xn+s/xn). (No typesetting here sorry.)  It is used as an simple to implement way to find an approximation to the square root that gets more precise the more you iterate, and was first used by the ancient babylonians and later the ancient greeks to estimate the square root, named after Hero of Alexandria, who was the first to provide a proof of it.  It can be derived through use of Newton's Method on X^2.  See Wikipedia for more.
